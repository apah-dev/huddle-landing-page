### What I learned

Learnt how to use both max-width and width at the same time to set the width of an element to 100% and set and max-width to prevent the element from going past it's container or overflowing it's container

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
section {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 70rem;
}
```
